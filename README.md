# Student Management System

This project “Student Information Management System” provides us a simple interface for maintenance of student information. It can be used by educational institutes or colleges and students to maintain the records of students easily. Achieving this objective is difficult using a manual system as the information is scattered, can be redundant and collecting relevant information may be very time consuming. All these problems are solved using this project. Throughout the project the focus has been on presenting information in an easy and intelligible manner
